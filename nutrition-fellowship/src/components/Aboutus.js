      <p className='aboutus-para1'>Nutrition Fellowship In Nepal comes together to celebrate the remarkable success of the National Vitamin A Program (NVAP) and the invaluable contributions of Female Community Health Volunteers (FCHVs) in transforming the nutritional landscape of Nepal.</p>

      <p className= 'aboutus-para2'>Established in 1993, NVAP has been a cornerstone in improving childrenâ€™s health and reducing child mortality across the nation. Through this initiative, over 50,000 dedicated FCHVs have distributed vitamin A capsules twice a year to children aged 6-59 months, ensuring access to essential nutrition at the grassroots level. This community-driven approach reaches every ward across all districts, embodying the spirit of inclusivity and commitment.</p>

      <p className='aboutus-para3'>We strive to mobilize generations to prioritize nutrition, create awareness, and advocate for sustainable solutions. By fostering collaboration among communities, professionals, and stakeholders, Nutrition Fellowship in Nepal envisions a healthier and better-nourished future for everyone.</p>
